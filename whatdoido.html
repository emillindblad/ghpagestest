    <h2>What do I do?</h2>
    <p>
        System architecture. Networking and security. No one in this
        house can touch me on that. But does anyone appreciate that?  While you were
        busy minoring in gender studies and singing a cappella at Sarah Lawrence, I was
        gaining root access to NSA servers.  I was one click away from starting a
        second Iranian revolution.

        I prevent cross-site scripting, I monitor for DDoS attacks, emergency database
        rollbacks and faulty transaction handlings.  The Internet, heard of it?
        Transfers half a petabyte of data every minute. Do you have any idea how that
        happens? All those YouPorn ones and zeroes streaming directly to your shitty
        little smart phone day after day? Every dipshit who shits his pants if he can't
        get the new dubstep Skrillex remix in under 12 seconds? It's not magic, it's
        talent and sweat. People like me ensuring your packets get delivered, un-sniffed.
        So what do I do? I make sure that one bad config on one key component
        doesn't bankrupt the entire fucking company. That's what the fuck I do. - <a title="Goldfoil" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_D3d1RWBrI"> Goldfoil </a>
